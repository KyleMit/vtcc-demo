# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

Vermont Code Camp is committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all who participate in all aspects of our event, online or in person, whether in a group or one-on-one.

We invite all those who participate in Vermont Code Camp to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Expected

* Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community. Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
